# Predicting Heart Disease using KNN
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset with features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
##  Objective
To build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on key health metrics.
##  Algorithm Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

##  Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap
- Count plots
- Pair plots
